## Quick start:

1. Go to your browser and open up the `index.html` page 
2. Only edit the following files to update content, styling, and images:

    a. `index.html` for content
    b. `css/hj-style.css` for styling
    c. `img/` for images

## Customize the following sections:

1. Both email signup forms in the Sign Up section at the bottom of the webpage (set up to work with Mailchimp by default)
2. Google Analytics code at the bottom of the `index.html` page
3. Meta tags and descriptions inside of `<head>`
4. Update the favicons to match your company/product. They are located in the root folder, and in `img/favicon/`.


## CSS classes and IDs:

- This theme uses `hj-` as the prefix to custom classes and IDs, and all can be modified in `css/hj-style.css`. All other classes are from [Materialize CSS](http://materializecss.com/), so be sure to read their documentation.
- The main sections use IDs (e.g., `#hj-about`) and all children elements are classes (e.g., `.hj-platform-container`)
- For all other classes, including colors and grid layout, look at [Materialize CSS](http://materializecss.com/) documentation
